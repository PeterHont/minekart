Scaffolding project to get us started. Uses gradle to handle
dependencies.

## Preparing your dev environment

You'll need Java and Gradle.

If you don't want to install gradle globally,
you can use ```./gradlew``` instead of ```gradle``` to run the scripts below (or ```gradlew.bat```on PC)

## Running

```gradle run```

A window should pop up. If so, your environment is up and running. Congrats :)

## Testing

```gradle test```
