# Minekart

Scaffolding project to get us started. Uses libgdx for graphics and gradle to handle
dependencies.

## Preparing your dev environment

You'll need Java and Gradle (v4, not the latest v5).

If you don't want to install gradle globally,
you can use ```./gradlew``` instead of ```gradle``` to run the scripts below (or ```gradlew.bat```on PC)

## Running

* ```./gradlew run``` 
* ```gradle run```

A window with a logo should pop up. If so, your environment is up and running. Congrats :)

## Testing

* ```./gradlew test``` 
* ```gradle test```

## Other tasks

Use this to see what else can be done:

* ```./gradlew tasks``` 
* ```gradle tasks```

## IDE integration

Just open build.gradle with IntelliJ or Eclipse,
and you will (hopefully) get a project automagically set up and ready to go.
